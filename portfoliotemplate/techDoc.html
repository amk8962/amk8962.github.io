            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. 
            It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, 
            and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
            It has a lot of use cases, namely:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web
               page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between 
              related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web documentation. HTML makes
               it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).
            </li>
            <li>I learned about all the important basic tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, links and more.
               I enjoyed practicing making simple pages and seeing how quickly I could build out layouts and structure using just HTML. It was 
              fascinating to learn how such a simple language could be used to build entire websites..</li>

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
